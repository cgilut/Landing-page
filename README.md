# Landing-page
Basic html and css project.

Before I started the project I thought it looked rather easy and would take me at most a day.
Turns out that wasn't the case.
I've spent a lot of time bashing my head against the wall trying to figure out how to do the simplest things, but in the end it all worked out.
I've had tones of fun and learnt a lot from this project.
